## Installation
Not available for public use yet. Once it's public, it will be available online hosted by a public server.

In order to test, download the repository and run it with your preferred IDE.
(Built on IntelliJ, therefore, IntelliJ recommended.)

IMPORTANT: Enable third party cookies in your browser, or else you won't be able to use the website properly (functionalities that require login will be compromised).

## Usage
The user will enter the website and provide the wanted tags and challenge size. Then, the tool will choose random reference images for that tag and a timer for each image for the artist to study.

The reference images are both images uploaded by other users and images uploaded by us (the devs).

## Contributing
Providing images for RefTick once it's possible is a nice way to contribute.

Development contributions are not possible at the moment due to it being a college project.
